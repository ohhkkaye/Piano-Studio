		<p style="color:#24248f"><b>Practice</b></p>
		Practice should be taken seriously and should be done everyday for at least 15 minutes.  It is much more efficient to practice a little bit a day rather than cramming an hour or two hours of practice the day before or the day of the lesson.  The specific ways to practice will be discussed in the lesson with the student and will also be explained to the parent/guardian.  
		<br>Minimum amount of practice should be between 15-30 minutes at least 4-5 times a week.
		<br>
		<p style="color:#24248f"><b>Lesson Procedure</b></p>
		Lessons are either half an hour (30 minutes) or 45 minutes once every week.  If requested and discussed, hour lessons may be offered.  I teach in students homes, but am now offering lessons in my own home if it works best.  I have a trial lesson/interview lesson where the parent/guardian is free to ask any other specific questions.  In this interview lesson, I discuss how lessons are conducted, expected practice habits of students, and payment.
		<br>
		<p style="color:#24248f"><b>Fees</b></p>
		Fees are can be discussed over the phone or by email.
		<br>
		<p style="color:#24248f"><b>Music, Books, & Supplies</b></p>
		Books, music, staff paper, and instrument supplies will be supplied by me and will be added to the bill at the end of the month.  
		<br>
		<p style="color:#24248f"><b>Rescheduling</b></p>
		I ask for a 24-hour notice for a lesson cancellation.  If the lesson needs to be cancelled for any reason, then we can work out a make-up lesson.  If a lesson should be cancelled, please contact me via telephone and email.  A notified missed lesson will not be charged.  I will return the courtesy and notify you at least 24 hours in advance (unless it is an emergency, I will notify the parent/guardian right away).  I will gladly reschedule the lesson.  My reschedule day for this coming session is Friday.
<b>Illness:</b>  Cancellation by illness of the same day will be charged half.  Please contact me as soon as possible.  Illness notification 24 hours in advanced will not be charged.  If the student can have a make-up lesson, then I will charge for the full lesson and make it up the following week.  
If I am ill, I will contact the student and the parent/guardian to notify ASAP.  This lesson will not be charged.
Summer lessons will be discussed when the time comes.  Lessons will not be given on major holidays including: Easter, Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, and Independence Day.  Other cancellations for other holidays will be discussed in the lessons prior to those days.
