	<h3> About</h3>
	<div class="about">
	<p> Kathleen has been teaching for nearly a decade and has been playing both the violin and piano since she was 9 years old. She began her love for music at a young age of 2 where she used to watch her favorite TV shows and sing along to all the disney movies she could get her hands on. As soon as she hit 7 years old, she received a small keyboard and she would play any melodies that were on the radio. It was then that her mother realized she needed piano lessons. </p>
	<p> Kathleen graduated from George Mason University's School of Music with a Bachelor of Arts in Music </p>
	<p> In college she picked up the viola and the cello as additional instruments. As she continues to teach, she has found love for teaching the arts to young musicians.</p>
